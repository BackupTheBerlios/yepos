README file for yepos

yepos is another dictionary program for PalmOS.
it's primary features are:
(0) RMS-sense freedom, you can use and distribute it under
    the terms of the GNU GPLv3+
(1) it is older devices-oriented:
    it runs on PalmOS 2.0 (probably slower than desired when running
    through compressed databases with large content records);
    on PalmOS 3.0 and later without restrictions;
    Palm IIIxe shall run it quite fluently;
    generally, one of the most important goals is to to minimise
    the power consumption;
    it is written with badly adjusted digitizer in mind
(2) it's host-side programs are written in C within C89 standard
    (apart from dependency on zlib), single object file per program,
    so should be very portable and easy to build
(3) it has both database compiler and decompiler to regenerate
    the database source file bit-to-bit
(4) compressed databases support (via SysZLib)
(5) minimalistic user interface, e.g. find action is triggered with
    carriage return stroke or `Find' hardware button; articles are
    scrolled like in Weasel with tap on upper/lower half of the screen;
    no form titles, no fancy buttons, no other non-functional decorations

In current alpha state some essential features are yet to be
implemented:
(0) proper articles output:
   (a) more modes (grammatical marks on/off, font/colour selections)
   (b) show full contents of long articles

Some not so important features that are also planned:
(0) reverse search (in articles bodies rather than in their titles)
(1) transliteration both for search input and sorting
(2) databases in memory cards as well as in Palm RAM

Not planned in foreseeable future:
(0) multibyte encodings support

There are other free dictionary programs available for PalmOS.
Here I list reasons why I didn't like them
(0) PalmOpenDic doesn't come with database decompiler;
    it's host tools are written in Java
    and I don't familiar with this language;
    the most important - it is very intellectual, but it is slow.
(2) PAdict is a wonderful work oriented on Japaneese
(3) PocketBabylon can't read compressed databases

Although yepos is free, PalmOS is not, so it is not very ethical to
support Palm producers by writing free programs that primarily run on their
proprietary system. yepos author writes the program for personally historical
reasons.
