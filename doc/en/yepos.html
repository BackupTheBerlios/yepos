<h2>What</h2>
<p>yepos is another dictionary program for PalmOS. it's primary features are:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>RMS-sense freedom, you can use and distribute yepos under the terms of the GNU GPLv3+</li>
<li>It is older devices-oriented: it runs on PalmOS 2.0 devices with 16&nbsp;MHz
DragonBall quite fluently (unfortunately, they can't bear any really large dictionary)</li>
<li>It's host-side programs are written in C within C89 standard
(apart from dependency on zlib), single object file per program,
so should be very portable and easy to build</li>
<li>it has both database compiler and decompiler to regenerate the database source file bit-to-bit</li>
<li>compressed databases support</li>
<li>minimalistic user interface, e.g. find action is triggered with
carriage return stroke or &lt;Find&gt; button;
articles are scrolled with tap on upper or lower half of the screen;
no form titles, no fancy buttons, no other non-functional decorations</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where</h2>
<p>The program lives in <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/projects/yepos">BerliOS</a>.
<a href="http://yepos.berlios.de/en">here is it's
English homepage</a>.</p>
<h2>Installation on Palm</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install SysZLib.prc, if it has not been yet.
if you don't install it, yepos won't understand compressed databases.
you may install SysZLib.prc after yepos.
you can find SysZLib.prc in <strong>bin/extern</strong> directory.</li>
<li>Install file yepos_en.prc (English) or yepos_lat.prc (Latin) or
yepos_ru.prc (Russian, KOI8-r encoding);
you can find these files in <strong>bin</strong> directory
of the distributed archive.</li>
<li>Install databases for dictionaries you want</li></ol>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The program has two forms. in the first one the words are listed; in the line
at the bottom you can write the word to search; when you tap the form title, yepos
toggles the mode between full and per-line. &lt;Menu&lt; button will fetch the second form,
where one can select dictionary databases.</p>
<h2>Creating dictionaries</h2>
<p>Here is described how to create dictionaries under Unix or her emulations.</p>
<h3>Building utilities</h3>
<p>All utilities except <strong>star2y.sed</strong> are written in C. in order to be run,
they should be translated with a C compiler, zlib being augmented.
There is <strong>Makefile</strong> in <strong>util/</strong> which declares the dependencies.
they are quite simple. in begin CFLAGS and LDFLAGS suitable for GNU compilers are assigned.</p>
<h3>yeposc</h3>
<p><strong>yeposc</strong> is database compiler. it creates files for Palm. here is it's usual
invocation:</p>
<blockquote><code>yeposc -i input.txt -o output.pdb -f 1</code></blockquote>
<p>The arguments are:
<ul>
<li><strong>-i input.txt</strong> input file with a list of articles</li>
<li><strong>-o output.pdb</strong> output PalmOS database</li>
<li><strong>-f 1</strong> this means the database should be compressed with zlib;
if you say <strong>-f 0</strong>, it won't compress</li>
<li><strong>-t lng</strong> maximum size of article title</li>
<li><strong>-r lng</strong> maximum article size</li>
<li><strong>-x lng</strong> size of index records</li></ul></p>
<p>Sizes are decimal number signifying lengths in bytes.</p>
<h4>File format</h4>
<p>Input file is divided into preamble and list of articles.</p>
<p>The preamble is placed at the beginning; it's lines begin with <em>#</em> or
with a space. those beginning with <em>#</em> will make the database comment,
those beginning with a space will define the alphabetic order.</p>
<p>The first line of the comment defines the database name in Palm;
the second will be the window title.</p>
<p>The alphabetic order is defined by the lines beginning with a space. the lines beginning
with two spaces are comments for the order. they are included into the database
but ignored. the order is defined as character groups separated with spaces.
the characters between spaces are equivalent. the absent characters are
considered to come before all the mentioned ones.</p>
<p>The preamble is followed by the list of articles. every three lines form an article,
the first contains the title, the second is a grammatical note, which is shown
in the full mode and omitted in the per-line one, the third line is the body.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>

<h3>ysort</h3>
<p><strong>ysort</strong> sorts the articles alphabetically. the preamble is preserved.
the invocation is</p>
<blockquote><code>ysort input.txt output.txt</code></blockquote>
<p>This utility should be run before <strong>yeposc</strong>.</p>
<h3>dict2y</h3>
<p><strong>dict2y</strong> transforms DICT databases. it works with <strong>dictunformat</strong>
from <strong>dictd</strong> distribution, this way:
<blockquote><code>
dictunformat serb2croat.index &lt;serb2croat.dict
| dict2y &gt;serb2croat.txt</code></blockquote>
where serb2croat.index is DICT database index file;
serb2croat.dict is decompressed DICT database. it can be decompressed with
<strong>gzip</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><code>gzip -dc &lt;serb2croat.dict.dz &gt;serb2croat.dict</code></blockquote>
<h3>star2y.sed</h3>
<p><strong>star2y.sed</strong> is a <strong>sed</strong> script; it tranforms
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/stardict">stardict</a> dictionaries
into <strong>yeposc</strong> format. to do this, install stardict-utils in your computer.
these utilities include <strong>stardict2txt</strong>, which we shall use.
<strong>stardict</strong> dictionaries come in <em>.tar.bz2</em> archives; in those archives
you can see files <em>.dict.dz</em>, <em>.ifo</em> et <em>.idx</em>. 
<em>.dict.dz</em> should be decompressed, <strong>gzip</strong> can do it:</p>
<blockquote><code>
  gzip -dc &lt;serb2croat.dict.dz &gt;serb2croat.dict
</code></blockquote>
<p>Then extract the list of articles:</p>
<blockquote><code>stardict2txt serb2croat.ifo</code></blockquote>
<p>This creates serb2croat.txt, which you can convert into
<strong>yeposc</strong> format:</p>
<blockquote>
 <code>sed -f star2y.sed &lt;serb2croat.txt &gt;s2c_y.txt</code>
</blockquote>
<p>After that write a preamble in the beginning of s2c_y.txt.</p>
<h3>deyepos</h3>
<p>Regenerates the source of a database created with <strong>yeposc</strong>. just say
<blockquote><code>deyepos voc.pdb voc.txt</code></blockquote>
</p>
<h3>Converting encodings</h3>
<p>If you use non-Latin letters, you may need to convert the encodings.
this can be done with many programs, e.g. GNU <strong>iconv</strong>.
naturally, it is <strong>yeposc</strong> input file that should be converted rather than
it's output.</p>
