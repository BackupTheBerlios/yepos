<h2>What</h2>
<p>yepos is another dictionary program for PalmOS. it's primary features are:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>RMS-sense freedom, you can use and distribute yepos under the terms of the GNU GPLv3+</li>
<li>It is older devices-oriented: it runs on PalmOS 2.0 devices with 16&nbsp;MHz
DragonBall quite fluently (unfortunately, they can't bear any really large dictionary)</li>
<li>It's host-side programs are written in C within C89 standard
(apart from dependency on zlib), single object file per program,
so should be very portable and easy to build</li>
<li>it has both database compiler and decompiler to regenerate the database source file bit-to-bit</li>
<li>compressed databases support</li>
<li>minimalistic user interface, e.g. find action is triggered with
carriage return stroke or &lt;Find&gt; button;
articles are scrolled with tap on upper or lower half of the screen;
no form titles, no fancy buttons, no other non-functional decorations</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where</h2>
<p>The program lives in <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/projects/yepos">BerliOS</a>.

English homepage</a>.</p>
<h2>Installation on Palm</h2>
<ol><li>Remove the previous version of the program, if it has been installed</li>
<li>Install SysZLib.prc, if it has not been yet.

you can find SysZLib.prc in <strong>bin/extern</strong> directory.</li>
<li>Install file yepos_en.prc (English) or yepos_lat.prc (Latin) or
yepos_ru.prc (Russian, KOI8-r encoding);
